 <h1 align="center"> üèó KireiSakura-Kit</h1>

KireiSakura-Kit is a library/framework based on [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) to easily write beautiful & powerful scripts.

> "KireiSakuraKit" is combination of two Japanese words, "Kirei" and "Sakura," along with the suffix "Kit". `Kirei(Á∂∫È∫ó)` means "simple" or "clean" & `Sakura(Ê°ú)` refers to cherry blossoms. Putting them together, "Kirei-SakuraKit" could be interpreted as a UI framework that emphasizes a beautiful and clean design inspired by the elegance of cherry blossoms. 

## Features:

- Written in purely bash, so this can be used in any script, just drop, include and use.
- Various UI elements for scripts with various log support.
- Many useful in-built core functionalities, no need to mannualy write from scratch.
- All modules are started with a prompt asking for user confirmation and ends with a footer with skip/success message.

## Idea & Statement:

- When I started learning bash, created some automation scripts for various things like adding chaotic AUR, installing packages etc. Then when I was updating my Oh-My-ZSH, I suddenly thought of making something similarly modular which can be used to do various things.....
- As for now this project is very Arch-linux centric as I use EndevourOS, but can be made to use with any distro.
- As I have just started learning bash and my knowledge is very little, this framework/library is very simple. But I believe this is be a very powerful & useful concept.
- Contribute if you find this useful and wanna make this more powerful.

## Methods & Guldelines:

- To be done.
- For now please see Utilities/test-module.sh for basic idea. also the main `Init-Script.sh` contains test functions too....
- Also the main script doesn't contain any Home UI for now...
